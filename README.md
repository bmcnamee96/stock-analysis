# Module 2: Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to use for loops to refactor the previously made code within the module. the purpose of refactoring the code was to make it run faster.  The faster the code, the more points of data that it can run though within a timely basis.

### Background
The background of this project deals with stock analysis.  Steve's parents purchased "DQ" stock but Steve believes that there is other stock that would be better for them.  The analysis of the stock shows us which stocks were positive and which were negative for 2017 or 2018. Although the data that Steve provided us was not that large, the refactored code could handle a larger file.

## Results
In order to refactor our code we created multiple for loops instead of the nested for loops like we created in the module.  The point of creating multiple for loops was to populate 3 different arrays with data. We first used a for loop to set all the volumes to 0 within the tickerVolumes array.  The next for loop was to populate the tickerVolume array, the tickerStartingPrices array, and the tickerEndingPrices array. The final foor loop took these arrays and output them onto our spreadsheet.  By creating separate for loops we were able to get our code to run faster and the excel sheet to populate with data faster.  Using arrays was an easy way to store the data that we went back to later on in the code.

### VBA Challenge 2017
As you can see from the below picture, the refactored code ran faster than the code we used in the module.

### VBA Challenge 2018
As you can see from the below picture, the refactored code ran faster than the code we used in the module.

## Summary
The advantage of refactoring code is that it can run faster, and can handle more data at once. Refactored code is also usually more readable and can be seen and understood by a third party when needed. When working within a team setting, have consice and easy to read/understand code is extremely important.  Refactoring code allows for larger data sets to be analyzed as well.  The larger the data set, the more that coding is needed, so having refactored code is perfect for massive amounts of data. Refactored code can also be edited and used on different projects more easily.  Because it is easier to read, we can use the same blocks of code on multiple things and only have to change a few titles or names.
